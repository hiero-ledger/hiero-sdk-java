> Please note that the minimal Android SDK level required for using the Hedera™ Java SDK in an Android project is **26**.

To get started with an Android project, you'll need to add the following **two** dependencies:

2. **gRPC implementation:**

> It is automatically aligned with the `grpc-api` version Hedera™ Java SDK use.
>
> ```groovy
> // okhttp transport (for lighter-weight applications or Android
> runtimeOnly("io.grpc:grpc-okhttp")
> ```
